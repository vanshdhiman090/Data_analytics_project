Leverage Top-Sellers: Advertise Pepperoni and Barbecue Chicken pizzas as "Customer Favorites."
Target Niche Markets: Market XXL pizzas for parties/events with a delivery guarantee.

Analyze Peak Times: Use order date/time data to staff efficiently during high-traffic periods.
Upsell Sides/Drinks: Pair popular pizzas with high-margin add-ons (e.g., garlic bread, sodas).

5. Address Zero-Sales Items
Reevaluate Ingredients: Replace unpopular pizzas with trending flavors (e.g., spicy or plant-based options).
Run Promotions: Offer free samples or BOGO deals for low-sales items to gauge customer interest.
