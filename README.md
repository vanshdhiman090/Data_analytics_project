# üçï Pizza Sales Data Analysis Project

In this project, I performed a comprehensive analysis of a pizza shop's sales data using SQL in collaboration with ChatGPT to derive valuable business insights. The dataset consisted of four core tables:

Pizzas
Pizza Types
Orders
Order Details

## Key Highlights:

Utilized advanced SQL joins, aggregate functions, and Common Table Expressions (CTEs) to analyze relationships between different datasets.
Extracted insights into sales performance, most popular pizza types, and revenue trends across various time periods.
Demonstrated strong proficiency in data modeling, query optimization, and translating raw data into actionable insights.
This project showcases my ability to work with relational databases and perform meaningful analysis to support data-driven decision-making.
